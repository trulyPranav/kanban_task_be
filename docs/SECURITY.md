## 1. Security Response Headers

The `SecurityHeadersMiddleware` injects the following headers on **every** HTTP response before it is sent to the client.

| Header | Value | Threat mitigated |
|---|---|---|
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` | MIME-type confusion / drive-by download attacks |
| `X-Frame-Options` | `DENY` | Clickjacking — prevents this API being embedded in an `<iframe>` |
| `Strict-Transport-Security` | `max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload` | SSL-stripping / MITM — forces HTTPS for 2 years including all subdomains |
| `Referrer-Policy` | `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` | Referrer leakage — cross-origin requests receive only the origin, not the full URL |
| `Permissions-Policy` | `geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()` | Fingerprinting / feature abuse — disables browser APIs not used by this service |
| `Content-Security-Policy` | `default-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'` | XSS fallback, prevents framing; tighten further when serving the Swagger UI |
| `Server` *(removed)* | — | Technology fingerprinting — strips the `uvicorn` version string from all responses |

### Notes for the frontend

- The `Strict-Transport-Security` header is only enforced by browsers once the first HTTPS response has been received. Ensure your deployment terminates TLS at the load balancer or reverse proxy and proxies to uvicorn over HTTP internally.
- If you host the Swagger UI or any HTML on the same origin, adjust `Content-Security-Policy` to allow `script-src 'self'` and `style-src 'self'`.

---

## 2. CORS Policy

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is managed by FastAPI's `CORSMiddleware`.

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| `allow_origins` | Configured via `CORS_ORIGINS` in `.env` — defaults to `["http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:5173"]` |
| `allow_credentials` | `true` — cookies and `Authorization` headers are allowed |
| `allow_methods` | `["*"]` — all HTTP methods |
| `allow_headers` | `["*"]` — all headers including `X-Request-ID` |

**To add your production frontend origin**, update `CORS_ORIGINS` in `.env`:

```env
CORS_ORIGINS=["https://app.yourdomain.com"]
```

> Do **not** use a wildcard `*` origin in production, especially when `allow_credentials` is `true`. Browsers reject `*` with credentials anyway — always enumerate your exact frontend origins.

---

## 3. Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is implemented with [slowapi](https://github.com/laurents/slowapi) (a Python port of Flask-Limiter) backed by an in-memory counter keyed on **the client's remote IP address**.

### How it works

1. Each request increments a sliding-window counter for that IP + endpoint combo.
2. When the counter exceeds the limit, `429 Too Many Requests` is returned immediately.
3. The `Retry-After` response header tells the client how many seconds to wait.

### Limits summary

| Resource action | Limit |
|---|---|
| Create user | 20 / minute |
| Read user(s) | 60 / minute |
| Update user | 20 / minute |
| Delete user | 10 / minute |
| Create task | 30 / minute |
| Read task(s) | 60 / minute |
| Update task | 30 / minute |
| Update task status (Kanban) | 60 / minute |
| Delete task | 20 / minute |
| Add comment | 30 / minute |
| Read comments | 60 / minute |
| Update comment | 20 / minute |
| Delete comment | 20 / minute |

### Frontend guidance

- Check for `429` responses and surface a user-friendly message.
- Read the `Retry-After` header and implement exponential back-off or a countdown before retrying.
- For Kanban drag-and-drop, use the dedicated `PATCH /tasks/{id}/status` endpoint (60/min) rather than the full `PUT` (30/min) to get double the throughput.

---

## 4. Request Tracing

The `RequestIDMiddleware` provides end-to-end trace correlation.

### How it works

- If the client sends `X-Request-ID: <your-uuid>` in the request, the server echoes it back on the response.
- If the header is absent, the server generates a fresh UUID v4 and returns it.

### Usage

```
Request  →  X-Request-ID: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
Response ←  X-Request-ID: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
```

- The server logs every unhandled error with the URL and method. If you pass `X-Request-ID`, include it in your bug reports to allow log correlation.
- Generate a fresh UUID per user action on the frontend, not per HTTP request, so you can tie a multi-request flow (e.g., create task + fetch board) to a single trace ID.

---

## 5. Input Validation

All input is validated by **Pydantic v2** before it reaches the service layer. No raw user input ever reaches a database query directly.

### String constraints

| Field | Min | Max | Pattern |
|---|---|---|---|
| `username` | 3 | 50 chars | `^[a-zA-Z0-9_.\-]+$` |
| `full_name` | 1 | 100 chars | — |
| `email` | — | — | RFC 5322 (via `pydantic[email]`) |
| `avatar_url` | — | 500 chars | — |
| `task.title` | 1 | 200 chars | — |
| `task.description` | — | 5000 chars | — |
| `comment.content` | 1 | 2000 chars | — |
| `search` query param | — | 100 chars | — |

### Enum validation

`status` and `priority` fields only accept the exact string values defined in the enum (see `API_REFERENCE.md §8`). Any other string returns `422`.

### Pagination bounds

| Param | Min | Max |
|---|---|---|
| `page` | 1 | — |
| `page_size` | 1 | 100 |

### Injection prevention

- All database queries use **SQLAlchemy ORM with parameterised statements** — user-supplied values are never interpolated into raw SQL strings, preventing SQL injection.
- No shell commands, template rendering, or `eval`-style execution is used anywhere in the codebase, preventing command injection and SSTI.
- Pydantic rejects unexpected fields by default — extra keys in request bodies are silently ignored (Pydantic v2 default), not executed.

## 6. Database Layer

### Driver & host

The backend connects to **Supabase (PostgreSQL 15)** via the `asyncpg` async driver through Supabase's **Transaction Pooler** (port `6543`). This mode is recommended for stateless API servers because each request borrows a connection from the pool rather than maintaining a persistent session.

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Driver | `asyncpg` |
| Host | `aws-0-<region>.pooler.supabase.com:6543` (Transaction Pooler) |
| TLS | Enforced — `DB_SSL=true` in `.env` injects a `ssl.create_default_context()` into the asyncpg connection |
| Configured via | `DATABASE_URL` + `DB_SSL` environment variables |

### Connection pool

SQLAlchemy manages an async connection pool to avoid the overhead of a new TLS handshake per request.

| Parameter | Value | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `pool_size` | `5` | Baseline connections kept alive; Supabase free tier allows ~15 total |
| `max_overflow` | `10` | Extra connections permitted under burst load (total ceiling: 15) |
| `pool_timeout` | `30 s` | Raises `TimeoutError` rather than queuing indefinitely if all connections are busy |
| `pool_recycle` | `1800 s` | Recycles connections every 30 min to prevent stale TCP issues behind NAT/load balancers |
| `pool_pre_ping` | `true` | Issues a cheap `SELECT 1` before each checkout to detect and replace dead connections silently |

### Async ORM

All database access goes through SQLAlchemy 2.0 async ORM with parameterised queries. The repository pattern keeps raw query logic isolated from business logic and routers.

### FK integrity

| Relationship | On delete behaviour |
|---|---|
| `Task.assigned_to_id → users.id` | `SET NULL` — task persists, assignee field cleared |
| `Task.created_by_id → users.id` | `SET NULL` — task persists, creator field cleared |
| `Comment.task_id → tasks.id` | `CASCADE` — comments are deleted with their parent task |
| `Comment.user_id → users.id` | `SET NULL` — comment persists, author becomes anonymous |

### Index strategy

Composite and single-column indexes are pre-defined on the most common query patterns:

- `(status, priority)` — Kanban column + priority filter
- `created_at` — default sort order
- `(assigned_to_id, created_by_id)` — filter by user
- `task_id` on comments — list comments for a task

---

## 7. Error Handling

### Principle: never leak internals

The global exception handler catches any unhandled `Exception` and returns a **generic** `500` message. Stack traces and internal details are only written to the **server log**, never to the API response.

```python
# What the client receives:
{ "detail": "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later." }

# What the server logs (include X-Request-ID in bug reports):
ERROR | Unhandled exception on GET /api/v1/tasks/...
Traceback (most recent call last): ...
```

### Predictable error shapes

All `4xx` errors return `{ "detail": "..." }` — a single string. `422` validation errors return `{ "detail": [...] }` — an array. See `API_REFERENCE.md §4.2` and `§4.3` for the exact shapes.

## 9. Recommendations Before Production

The following items are **not implemented** and must be addressed before deploying to a production environment.

### 9.1 Authentication & Authorisation (A01 / A07)

The API currently has no authentication layer. Any caller can read, modify, or delete any resource.

**Recommended approach:**
- Add JWT Bearer token authentication using [`python-jose`](https://github.com/mpdavis/python-jose) or [`authlib`](https://docs.authlib.org/).
- Protect all mutating endpoints with a `get_current_user` dependency.
- Add ownership checks (e.g., only the task creator or assignee can update a task).
- Consider OAuth 2.0 / OIDC with a provider (Supabase Auth, Auth0, Clerk) if you want social login.

### 9.2 HTTPS / TLS Termination

The `Strict-Transport-Security` header is included but only meaningful once TLS is active. In production:

- Terminate TLS at a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy) or load balancer (AWS ALB).
- Never expose uvicorn directly on port 80 or 443 in production.

### 9.3 Persistent Rate Limit Store

The current in-memory rate limiter resets on every server restart and does not work across multiple instances. In production use a Redis backend:

```python
from slowapi import Limiter
from slowapi.util import get_remote_address

limiter = Limiter(
    key_func=get_remote_address,
    storage_uri="redis://localhost:6379",
)
```

Add `redis` to `requirements.txt`.

### 9.4 Secrets Management

- Rotate `DATABASE_URL` credentials regularly.
- Use a secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Doppler) rather than a `.env` file on production servers.
- Never commit `.env` — it is already in `.gitignore`.

### 9.5 Database

✅ **Implemented** — the backend now connects to **Supabase (PostgreSQL)** via `asyncpg` with TLS enforced and a tuned SQLAlchemy connection pool (see §6).

Remaining actions:
- Enable **Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)** in the Supabase dashboard for automated backups (available on Pro tier).
- On the free tier, export a manual backup periodically via `pg_dump`:
  ```bash
  pg_dump "$(grep DATABASE_URL .env | cut -d= -f2-)" > backup_$(date +%F).sql
  ```
- Rotate the database password in Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Database → Reset database password, then update `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`.

### 9.6 Dependency Auditing

Run regularly to catch known CVEs in dependencies:

```bash
pip install pip-audit
pip-audit
```

### 9.7 Content-Security-Policy Tightening

The current CSP (`default-src 'none'`) is correct for a pure JSON API. If you add Swagger UI endpoints, adjust:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:; frame-ancestors 'none'
```
